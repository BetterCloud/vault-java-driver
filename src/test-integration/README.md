Intro
=====
Unit tests, which do not rely on a Vault server being available, are separated from these
integration tests, which do require a Vault instance.

Running the Integration Tests
=============================
Originally this test suite required a decent amount of manual setup. You had to run and configure a
Vault server instance on your machine, and populate several environment variables with values that
would be picked up by the tests.

Since then, the tests have been modified to work
with [TestContainers](https://www.testcontainers.org/), a Java library that efficiently manages
Docker containers and makes them available to JUnit tests. So now, setup of the Vault server
instance is entirely automated, and dealt with by the test suite itself.

However, to run these tests you do need to have a current version of Docker installed on your
machine. This is supported for Linux, OS X, and Windows, although the details vary significantly
between those operating systems.See the [Docker website](https://www.docker.com/) for information on
installing Docker on your OS, after checking also with the TestContainers website for OS-specific
caveats (Windows in particular).

With Docker installed on your machine, you can run this test suite using the `integrationTest`
Gradle task:

`$ ./gradlew integrationTest`
